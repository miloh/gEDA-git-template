short temporary todo
--------------------

o setup template as a submodule/subdir that is decoupled from the project
o fix gerber creation so it's more make-like (currently gerber exports aren't named)
o fix bom export to reduce proliferation of targets for pcb-rnd and pcb
o makefile shouldn't use bash, depend on posix shell 
o fix dependencies to be more make-like
